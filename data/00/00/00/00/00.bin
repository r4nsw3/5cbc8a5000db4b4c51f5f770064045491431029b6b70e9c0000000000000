  |   Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three        |
  |   styles of play: the deep tactics of card games with the rich          |
  |   strategy of table top board games, combined with a character          |
  |   role-playing system.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As a hero from one of the clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme,     |
  |   hire agents, explore, vanquish monsters, cast spells and face off     |
  |   against other players, with one ultimate end goal in mind -           |
  |   storming the palace and becoming King or Queen of Armello. The        |
  |   Kingdom of Armello is as dangerous as it is beautiful, perils,        |
  |   banes and bandits hide around every corner and a spreading            |
  |   corruption known as the Rot is leaving no creature untouched.         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   An update is live across the globe for Armello players on Nintendo    |
  |   Switch that has a few broad sweeping improvements under the hood.     |
  |   Basically, we've made some important changes to reduce the            |
  |   prevalence of crashes, and make them easier to track in case          |
  |   something else pops up.                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Fixed an issue that would cause the main menu to become             |
  |   unresponsive.                                                         |

  |   - Reduce instances of crashes in game, with tracking implemented for  |
  |   future improvements.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   - Reduce instances of crashes in multiplayer lobbies, with tracking   |
  |   implemented for future improvements.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Let me know if there's anything else that pops up!                    |
